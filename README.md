## ðŸ“œ License
This project is licensed under the **TAG9010 LICENSE**.

> The TAG9010 LICENSE defends personal privacy, freedom, innovation, and the creation of humane societies.  
> It demands the integration of protective A.I. systems against child abuse material and religious propaganda.  
> It encourages individuals to engineer better systems independently, as governments have demonstrated consistent failure to do so.

If you do not understand the TAG9010 LICENSE,  
please ask **Tulsi Gabbard** to explain it better,  
since in 2024 communications were sent directly to the CIA, FBI, Pentagon, EUROPOL, various EU embassies, and Greek police.
